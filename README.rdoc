== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

- 2.21

* System dependencies

- none, clone repo, run "rails s" to start server.


* Note

- This code is still under development, parts of this may not work currently, rails s currently will not work. Will be resolved in the coming days.
